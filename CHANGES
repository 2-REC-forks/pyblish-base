pyblish Changelog
=================

This contains all major version changes between pyblish releases.

Version 1.0.8

	optional `name` attribute that will replace the
	default class-name used when visualising a plug-in
	name.

    where Pyblish will look for configuration files, via the
    PYBLISHCONFIGPATH variable.

	individual repositories.

Version 1.0.6
-------------

- New API members: plugins_by_family, plugins_by_host and 
	instances_by_plugin
