pyblish Changelog
=================

This contains all major version changes between pyblish releases.

Version 1.0.16
--------------

- API: Added pyblish.api.current_host()
- API: Plug-in paths can no longer be modified by altering
    the results returned from pyblish.api.plugin_paths()
- API: Paths are no longer made absolute during registration.

Version 1.0.15
--------------

- API: Plugin.repair_* documented and implemented by default
- API: Added lib.where()
- API: Added `.id` attribute to instances and plug-ins

Version 1.0.14
--------------

- Added pyblish.api.version
- Matched verbosity level from processing context as the processing of instances.
- Processing logic change; processing of plug-in *without* compatible instances will now *not* yield anything; previously it yielded a pair of (None, None).

Version 1.0.13
--------------

- Added pyblish.api.sort_plugins
- Added ordered output to pyblish.api.discover
- pyblish.api.plugins_by_family now yields correct results
    for plug-ins with wildcard families.
- Refactored main.py into util.py

Version 1.0.12
--------------

- plugin.py reloadable without loosing currently loaded plug-ins
- Basic plug-in manager "Manager"
- Simplified configuration (no more user or custom configuration)
- Simplifying discover() (no more indirection)
- Adding default logger (good bye "No logger found..")
- Temporarily removig CLI
- Context is no longer a Singleton
- Added forwards compatibility for Collector plug-in

Version 1.0.11
--------------

- Added ability to process individual instances from within context

Version 1.0.10
--------------

- Fixing PyPI installation

Version 1.0.9
-------------

- Requires. Plug-ins may now specify a version with which they
    are compatible with, using [iscompatible][] which is a
    requirements.txt-like syntax for dependency specifications.
- Improved logging, including visualisation of which instance
    is currently being processed by each plug-in.
- iscompatible is now included in /vendor

Version 1.0.8
-------------

- Nice name for Plug-ins. A plug-in can now carry an
	optional `name` attribute that will replace the
	default class-name used when visualising a plug-in
	name.
- Configurable configuration location. Users can now specify
    where Pyblish will look for configuration files, via the
    PYBLISHCONFIGPATH variable.
- Registered path no longer have to exist. To align better with
    paths added via environment variables or configuration, the
    registration of paths is now okay even though the path may
    not exist. A non-existing path will simply be discarded upon
    discovery (and log a warning message).
- Auto-repair. pyblish.main.publish() now takes a auto_repair flag
    with which the Plugin.repair_instance method is called. If a
    repair fails, a message is logged, otherwise the validation is
    considered a success and publishing resumes.
- Plug-ins for other hosts than the currently running host are
    discarded upon discovery. This means that they will be invisible
    to any incompatible host.
- Optional plug-ins. A plug-in may now be marked "optional" and thus
    be ignored during processing by user-request using
    pyblish.main.publish(include_optional=False)

Version 1.0.7
-------------

- Improved logging of pyblish.main.publish()
- Refactored backend/frontend; frontends now in their own
	individual repositories.
- Added landscape.io code-quality badge

Version 1.0.6
-------------

- New API members: plugins_by_family, plugins_by_host and 
	instances_by_plugin
- Improved print of Context and Instance
 	Context now prints members, like a regular list
 	and Instance prints its name and class relation.
- Implemented Context.delete() to simplify working with a Singleton.

Version 1.0.5
-------------

- Redefined and simplified configuration
- Moving API from root package to namespace "api"
- Initial version of command-line interface (cli)
- Initial version of package-control using cli
