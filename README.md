Feature film-strength quality assurance for content; built for platform, software and language agnosticism. Free, community-driven and licensed under LGPLv3.

### Getting started

Pyblish is in development, but will remain functional at all times.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish.git
```

To get up and running with Maya:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abstractfactory/pyblish-maya.git
```

You'll need to append both repositories to your PYTHONPATH, in addition to the `/publish-maya/publish_maya/pythonpath` directory. This is what will make Pyblish appear as an item in your File-menu.
